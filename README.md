# LGTM Enterprise extension for Visual Studio

:warning: The LGTM Enterprise for Visual Studio plugin is deprecated. Other than security fixes, there will be no new releases of this plugin, though the final release will remain compatible with new versions of LGTM Enterprise.

This repository contains [binary releases](https://github.com/Semmle/lgtm-visualstudio-binaries/releases) of the Visual Studio extension for LGTM Enterprise. **Please note that use of the LGTM Enterprise application and its IDE extensions requires a separate license agreement with GitHub.**

For more information or assistance with this product, please refer to the LGTM Enterprise help.

Note that this plugin is designed to work with [Microsoft Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), not to be confused with [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/). There is no extension to import alerts from LGTM Enterprise into
VSCode, but there is a [VSCode extension for writing and running CodeQL queries](https://help.semmle.com/codeql/codeql-for-vscode.html).
